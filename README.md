## Project Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical credit card transactions and identify patterns associated with fraudulent activities. By leveraging these patterns, the system can accurately detect fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Project Structure

The project directory consists of the following components:

1. **`data`**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models. It includes both the original dataset and any preprocessed data files.

2. **`notebooks`**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Each notebook is dedicated to a specific step of the project pipeline.

3. **`models`**: This directory contains trained machine learning models saved as serialized files. These models can be loaded and used for predicting fraud in new credit card transactions.

4. **`src`**: This directory contains the source code of the project. It includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and fraud detection. The code is organized into different modules for better readability and maintainability.

5. **`documentation`**: This directory contains project documentation, including the project report, user manual, and any other relevant documents.

6. **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists the dependencies and Python libraries required to run the project. Use the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Getting Started

To get started with the Credit Card Fraud Detection System project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak22903/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_System_Final
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   pip install --user -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the project workflow.

6. Run the Python scripts in the `src` directory to preprocess data, train models, and detect fraud.
